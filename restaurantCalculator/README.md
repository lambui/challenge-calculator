# String Calculator Challenge

## Assume: 
 - input numbers are integer, any other numbers (like float) are invalid numbers. This is because if delimiter is a period, it can cause problem and there are no clear indication on "number" having to include float.
 - output number can be float, since there are division.

## Structure:
 - Main project code is in <b>restaurantCalculator</b>
 - Unit test code is in <b>restaurantCalculator.Tests</b>

 - Main project:  
   1. go to <b>restaurantCalculator</b>
   1. dotnet run
 - Unit tests:
   1. go to <b>restaurantCalculator.Tests</b>
   2. dotnet test
